## üìã Features

- **MKV to MP4 Conversion**: Automatically converts MKV files to more widely-compatible MP4 format
- **Subtitle Extraction**: Detects and extracts embedded subtitles to SRT files
- **Audio Codec Fixing**: Identifies and re-encodes non-AAC audio to the AAC codec for better compatibility
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Optimizes performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores
- **Professional UI**: Color-coded terminal interface with progress tracking
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive processing reports with file-by-file details

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FFmpeg installed and available in system PATH
- Required Python packages (see Installation)

## üì• Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurushothMathav/avp.git
cd avp
```

2. **Install required Python packages**

```bash
pip install colorama tqdm tabulate psutil
```

3. **Install FFmpeg**

- **Windows**:
  - Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - Add to your system PATH

- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Place your video files in the `videos` folder**

```bash
mkdir -p videos
# Copy your video files to the videos folder
```

2. **Run the script**

```bash
python avp.py
```
or

```
run avp-portable.bat file
```

3. **View the results**
   - Real-time progress is displayed in the terminal
   - A detailed report is generated at the end of processing
   - A complete log is saved to `video_processing_report.txt`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the following variables at the top of `main.py` to customize behavior:

```python
# Folder containing your video files
INPUT_FOLDER = "videos"  # Change this to your preferred input directory

# Number of processing threads
NUM_THREADS = max(1, multiprocessing.cpu_count() - 2)  # Automatically set based on CPU
```

## üìä Processing Report

The tool generates a detailed report after processing that includes:

- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Total files processed
  - Number of MKV files converted
  - Number of subtitles extracted
  - Number of audio tracks fixed
  - Total processing time
  - Success rate

- **File Details**:
  - Resolution
  - Duration
  - Original and final file sizes
  - Actions performed on each file

- **Error Log**: Any errors encountered during processing

## üîÑ Processing Workflow

1. **File Analysis**: Each video file is analyzed to determine its format, codecs, and structure
2. **Format Conversion**: MKV files are converted to MP4 format
3. **Subtitle Extraction**: If subtitles are detected, they are extracted to SRT files
4. **Audio Processing**: Non-AAC audio is re-encoded to AAC for better compatibility
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress is displayed in the terminal
6. **Reporting**: A comprehensive report is generated and saved

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Custom FFmpeg Parameters

For advanced users, you can modify the FFmpeg parameters in the code to customize:

- Video encoding options
- Audio bitrate settings
- Subtitle format preferences
- Stream mapping options

### Batch Processing

The tool is designed for batch processing - simply place multiple files in the input folder, and they will all be processed in a single run.
